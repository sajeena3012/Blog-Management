<h1>üìù Blog Management System</h1>
A simple blog web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. This project allows users to:

Create new blog posts

View all posts

Edit existing posts

Delete posts

It follows a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) structure with clean routing, server-side rendering, and custom styling using CSS. Ideal for learning full-stack web development and RESTful APIs.
